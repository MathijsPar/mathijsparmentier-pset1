  # Mr. Potatohead
  This app is an accurate portayal of the infamous toy invented and developed by
  George Lerner in 1949. In a fully interactive way, users can choose which
  body parts or garments to display and which to keep hidden. Daring users might
  even rotate the screen for a more spacious view of Mr. Potatohead.

  For a demonstration of the app, I have included two screenshots in the doc
  folder.
